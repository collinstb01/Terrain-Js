How to validate an address

Addresses are typically base32 encoded. But for multichain smart contracts no assumptions
should be made other than being UTF-8 encoded and of reasonable length

'''
let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_validate(input)?;

let rec: Addr = deps.api.addr_validate(rec_address)?;

Balance.update(
    deps.storage,
    &rec,
    | banlance: Option<Uint128> | -> StdResult< > {
        Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default() + amount)
    },
)?;
